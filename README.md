# IC Irvine's Teaching and Learning in Computing Lab
Lead by Drs. Sergio Gago-Masague and Jennifer Wong-Ma, the Teaching and Learning in Computing lab is focused on the fusion of Artificial Intelligence and CS Education. Our work leverages a variety of techniques from AI to understand and solve problems in CS Ed. In doing so, we seek to improve outcomes for all CS students.
